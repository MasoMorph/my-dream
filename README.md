## About the Architect
Mohamad Amine (MasoMorph) — systems enthusiast from Tetouan, Morocco.  
Student at Mehdi Benouna High School (English Branch), the only class of its kind in the province. Fluent English has given me access to international research that fuels a single dream: revolutionize computing by breaking the physical and conceptual limits of the status quo.

## The "M'allem" Foundation
Before I wrote code I fixed things. From the neighborhoods of Boujarah I built a reputation for bringing dead electronics back to life.

Core hands-on experience:
- Systems: deep troubleshooting and optimisation across Windows (legacy → modern) and Linux (Debian-based, Arch-based).  
- Hardware: repairs on PCs, smartphones, and household electronics (refrigerators, electric toothbrushes, etc.).  
- Migration: moved away from mainstream distributions toward Devuan and Artix after discovering the structural decay produced by monolithic init systems like systemd.

## Dreams & Scientific Aspirations

### 1. The Balanced Ternary Revolution
Goal: create research and reference implementations for Balanced Ternary Logic (-1, 0, 1) as a foundation for new computing architectures.
- Efficiency: target higher information density using radix-economy concepts (e ≈ 2.718).
- Native logic: explore hardware and low-level designs where ternary states and negative representations are natural primitives rather than awkward emulations.
- Outcome: a research-grade Ternary Math Library and simulations to show practical advantages.

### 2. A Pure Unix-Philosophy Kernel
Goal: design a clean-slate microkernel that honors Unix philosophy — small, composable, and auditable.
- Rationale: modern Linux ecosystems have grown monolithic; too much redundant, opaque code and vendor-controlled black boxes (e.g., Intel ME) erode sovereignty.
- Mission: a modular, transparent, and minimal kernel that avoids hidden subsystems and maximizes user control.

### 3. The Ternary Internet & Digital Sovereignty
Goal: design protocols and architecture for an Internet natively influenced by ternary logic and decentralization.
- Objective: break centralization by enabling native encryption, higher-throughput primitives where ternary states help, and peer-first architectures.
- Vision: empower high-capacity personal systems and federated networks to reduce reliance on corporate-controlled infrastructure.

## Current Research Lab
- Hardware: HP Compaq 8000 SFF (this is currently a bottleneck for C compilations).  
- Environment: Devuan / Artix (init-freedom).  
- Education / Community: 1337 School (42 Network) candidate — working toward professional-grade systems architecture skills.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Phase 0 — Acquire decommissioned hardware to expand the testbed.  
- [ ] Phase 1 — Publish a working Ternary Math Library on GitHub (reference implementations + tests).  
- [ ] Phase 2 — Design a clean-slate microkernel that follows strict Unix principles.  
- [ ] Phase 3 — Simulate a Ternary-to-Binary bridge for cross-platform protocol testing and interoperability.  
- [ ] Phase 4 — Open-source a complete Ternary OS environment with docs and reproducible builds.

Each phase will include research notes, reproducible artifacts, and a set of minimal demos.

## How to Help / Contact
I’m looking for:
- Academic guidance and mentorship in architecture, low-level design, and numerical systems.
- Hardware donations (decommissioned desktops, test boards) to scale compilation and simulation capacity.
- Technical collaborators interested in minimal kernels, novel numeric systems, or decentralized protocols.

## Statement
"I make the path clearer from now on. The system hasn't just slowed down; it has failed its original philosophy. It's time to rebuild."
