The Ternary Manifesto: Reclaiming the Machine🚀 Towards a Non-Binary, Decentralized, and Bloat-Free Future👤 About MeI am Mohamad Amine Belali, a systems enthusiast based in Tetouan, Morocco. While the world is content with the binary status quo, I see a computing landscape "poisoned" by forty years of legacy code, proprietary "black-box" subsystems, and inefficient architectures.My journey started in the streets of Boujarah, where I became the family "m'allem," repairing everything from smartphones and HP towers to refrigerators and electric brushes. This taught me the most important lesson in engineering: Hardware is reality, and if you cannot control it, you do not own it.🏛️ My Dreams & Research Goals1. The Balanced Ternary RevolutionModern computing is hitting a wall. The von Neumann bottleneck and the energy demands of AI require a more efficient path. I am researching Balanced Ternary Logic (-1, 0, 1).Objective: Implement a full-stack ternary ecosystem.Why: To utilize the Radix Economy ($e \approx 2.718$) and eliminate the redundancy of Two's Complement math.2. A Pure Unix-Philosophy KernelI am building a custom kernel that rejects the monolithic bloat of modern Linux.The Critique: Systems like systemd have violated the principle of "doing one thing and doing it well."The Path: A modular microkernel architecture that provides user sovereignty and transparency, moving away from the hidden code in Intel/Microsoft ecosystems.3. The Ternary Internet Protocol (TIP)Our current internet is controlled by conglomerates and limited by binary throughput.Dream: A protocol with native encryption and higher data density through ternary states, enabling a truly decentralized high-performance network.🛠️ The Lab (Current Setup)Station: HP Compaq 8000 SFF (The "Frankenstein" Unit).Environment: Devuan / Artix Linux (No-systemd).Languages: C, Assembly, Shell.📈 Roadmap[ ] Phase 0: Secure hardware laboratory (Ongoing - University Outreach).[ ] Phase 1: Document a complete Balanced Ternary math library in C.[ ] Phase 2: Simulate a Ternary-to-Binary bridge to allow ternary logic to run on binary silicon.[ ] Phase 3: Develop the "Setun-Next" Microkernel bootloader.[ ] Phase 4: Transition to 1337 (42 Network) to scale the software architecture.📬 Connect with MeIf you are a professor, a fellow "purist," or a low-level engineer, let's talk about the future."Perhaps the most beautiful of all number systems is the balanced ternary notation." — Donald Knuth
